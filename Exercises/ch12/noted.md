## 12.1 Objects and Functions
<ul> 
<li> OOP allows programs to be made up of a collection of structure definitions and function definitions, where most of the functions operate on specific kinds of structures.</li>
<li> Member function differ from functions in two ways:
<ul><li>When we call a member function the object is invoked rather than called. The difference between the two being that invoking is preforming a operation on the object. </li> <li>Function is declared inside a struct definition </li></ul></li>

</ul>

## 12.2
<ul>
<li> The :: operator indicates that the function can be invoked on a structure, Time :: print() </li>
<li> The keyword 'this' is a pointer that points to the structure you invoke, using * we can refer to the struct itself. </li>
<li> The definition of the member function is called the implementation of the function, when you declare a function you tell the compiler the implementation (definition) will be there (otherwise a error will occur).</li>
<li> </li>
</ul>

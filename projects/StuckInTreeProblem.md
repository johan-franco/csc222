## Kitten on a Tree
Ouch! A kitten got stuck on a tree. Fortunately, the
treeâ€™s branches are numbered. Given a description
of a tree and the position of the kitten, can you write
a program to help the kitten down?
## Input
The input is a description of a single tree. The first
line contains an integer K, denoting the branch on
which the kitten got stuck. The next lines each contain two or more integers a, b1, b2, . . .. Each such
line denotes a branching: the kitten can reach a
from b1, b2, . . . on its way down. Thus, a will be
closer to the root than any of the bi.
## The description
ends with a line containing -1. Each branch bi will
appear on exactly one line. All branch numbers are
in the range 1..100, though not necessarily contiguous. You are guaranteed that there is a path from
every listed branch to the root. The kitten will sit
on a branch that has a number that is different than the root.
The illustration above corresponds to the sample input.
## Output
Output the path to the ground, starting with the branch on which the kitten sits.
